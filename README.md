 This project will start with me creating a virtualbox VM on my local machine.

 I will then obtain the kickstart file from /root/anaconda-ks

 Next will be the installation of Wazuh

 Then I will attempt to gain access to a Wazuh template from the user interface so the installation can be automated for the Airmen.

 Once configuration is complete I will begin hardening the system with the guidance of DISA STIGs. Likely utilizing the Ansible Playbook provided by DISA.

 While all of this is being done I will be adding the configurations to git hub to ensure version control

 A build script will be generated to stage the content, generate ZIPs, split the zips, and finally build the ISOs.
